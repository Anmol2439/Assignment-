        "4.Result Collection: Once a task is completed, the result is collected and can be retrieved by the main program.\n",

        "Why Use Multiprocessing?\n",
        "1.Bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):\n",
        "Python’s GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound programs. Multiprocessing sidesteps this by using separate memory spaces for each process, allowing full utilization of multiple CPU cores1.\n",
        "2.Improved Performance:\n",
        "By running multiple processes in parallel, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete tasks, especially those that are CPU-intensive. This is because each process runs independently and can be executed on different CPU cores2.\n",
        "3.Better Resource Utilization:\n",
        "Multiprocessing allows you to leverage the full power of your machine’s CPU, making it ideal for tasks that require heavy computation, such as data processing, scientific calculations, and machine learning3.\n",
        "How It Works\n",
        "•Process Creation:\n",
        "You create a Process object and then call its start() method to begin execution. Each process runs in its own memory space, which means they do not share data directly. Communication between processes is typically done using pipes or queues1."

        "1.Try-Catch Blocks: Wrapping concurrent tasks in try-catch blocks allows for immediate handling of exceptions within the thread. This is a fundamental technique used in many programming languages1.\n",
        "2.Future and Promise: In languages like Java and C++, futures and promises can be used to handle exceptions. When a task completes, the future object can be checked for exceptions, allowing the main thread to handle them appropriately1.\n",
        "3.Thread Pools and Executors: Using thread pools and executor services can help manage exceptions by centralizing exception handling logic. For example, in Java, the ExecutorService can be used to submit tasks and handle exceptions through the Future interface1.\n",
